\chapter{Finals}

The competition ends with the Finals on the last day, where the five teams with the highest total score compete.
The \iterm{Finals} are conducted as a final open demonstration.
This demonstration does not have to be different from the other open demonstrations---open challenge and demo challenge. 
It does not have to be the same either.

\section{Final Demonstration}
In the final demonstration, every team qualified for the Finals can choose freely what to demonstrate. 
The demonstration is evaluated by both a league-internal and a league-external jury.

\subsection{Task}
The procedure for the demonstration and the timing of slots is as follows:
\OpenDemonstrationTask{ten}{five}

\subsection{Evaluation and Score System}
The demonstration is evaluated by both a league-internal and a league-external jury.
The final score and ranking are determined by the two jury evaluations and by the previous performance of the team.
\begin{enumerate}
{\bf\item League-internal jury:} The league-internal jury is formed by the Executive Committee.
The evaluation of the league-internal jury is based on the following criteria:
  \begin{compactenum}
  \item Scientific contribution %(maybe taken from the OC)
  \item Contribution to @Home %(evaluated by Execs/TC)
  \item Relevance for @Home / Novelty of approaches %(evaluated by execs/TC)
  \item Presentation and performance in the finals.
  \end{compactenum}
It is expected that teams present their scientific and technical contributions in both \iterm{team description paper} and the \iterm{RoboCup\char64Home Wiki}.
In addition, finalist teams may provide a printed document to the jury (max 2 pages) that summarizes the demonstrated robot capabilities and contributions.  

  The influence of the league-internal jury to the final ranking is \SI{25}{\percent}.

{\bf\item League-external jury:} The league-external jury consists of people not being involved in the RoboCup@Home league,
but having a related background (not necessarily robotics).
They are appointed by the Executive Committee.
The evaluation of the league-external jury is based on the following criteria:
  \begin{compactenum}
  \item Originality and Presentation
    (story-telling is to be rewarded)
  \item Usability / Human-robot interaction
  \item Multi-modality / System integration
  \item Difficulty and success of the performance
  \item Relevance / Usefulness for daily life
  \end{compactenum}
  The influence of the league-external jury to the final ranking is \SI{25}{\percent}.

{\bf\item Previous performance:} \SI{50}{\percent} of the final score are determined by the team's previous performance during the competition.
\end{enumerate}
