\label{sec:eegpsr}

This test evaluates the abilities of the robot that are required throughout the set of tests in stages I and II of this (2016) and previous years. In this test the robot has to solve multiple tasks upon request over an extended period of time (30-45 minutes). That is, the test is not incorporated into a (predefined) story and there is neither a predefined order of tasks nor a predefined set of actions. The actions that are to be carried out by the robot are chosen randomly by the referees from a larger set of actions. These actions are organized in three categories with different, incremental, complexity. Scoring thereby depends on the complexity class.

\subsection{Focus}
This test particularly focuses on the following aspects:
\begin{itemize}
	\item No predefined order of actions to carry out (to get away from state machine-like behavior programming).

	\item Increased complexity in speech recognition (possible commands are less restricted in both actions/operators and arguments/objects, commands can include multiple objects, e.g., \quotes{put the apple on the kitchen table}).

	\item More advanced capabilities (e.g. activity detection, unknown object description, pouring, manipulating tray, etc.).

	\item Environmental (high-level) reasoning, including:
  \begin{itemize}
	\item Memory (robot must remember performed actions).
	\item Awareness (events may occur while the robot is waiting for a command).
  \end{itemize}

  \item Robust long-term operation.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Task}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Entering and command retrieval:} The robot enters the arena and drives to a designated position where it has to wait for further commands. \\

	\item \textbf{Command generation:} A command is generated randomly depending on the abilities chosen by the team (see \refsec{sec:eegpsr-abilities}) and those which haven't been evaluated yet. The command is composed by up to three actions that the robot has to show it has recognized. The robot may repeat the understood command and ask for confirmation. If it can't recognize the command correctly, it can also ask the speaker to repeat the whole command again.

	The command may not include all the information being necessary to accomplish the task. In those cases, the robot can ask questions to retrieve the missing information about the task, but is not required to. In the questions the robot has to make clear what it has already understood, e.g., tell the operator that it has understood to bring a particular beverage can, but not where can is located in the arena. The robot may also simply start searching. \\

	Each new generated command may require information from the previously given ones. Also, the difficulty of the new commands will be increased with respect of the previously generated ones. \\

	\item \textbf{Task assignment:} The robot is given a command by the operator and may directly start to work on the task assignment. If a robot is unable to perform a command, it should get back to the operator, and clearly state \textbf{why} it wasn't able to accomplish the task. \\

	\item \textbf{Answering questions:} After the first command has been (partially) accomplished, the operator may ask the robot to provide information about its actions and the environment, such as: what the robot has just accomplished, the location of a person or object, number of people in a given room, the state of a door, what the robot is holding, etc. \\

	\item \textbf{Task execution:} The robot must stop the execution of a task and return to its designated position within \eegpsrMaxCmdTime minutes. Otherwise the robot must be moved to its designated position immediately. If a restart is still available to the team, it can be restarted at the designated position. \\

	\item \textbf{Returning:} After accomplishing the assigned task, the robot has to move back to its designated position to wait and retrieve the next command (i.e., go back to 1. without the need of re-entering the arena). The robot can work on at most \eegpsrMaxCmd commands. \\

	\item \textbf{Timing:} The total time allotted to the robot for command retrieval and task execution is \eegpsrMaxTeamTime minutes. If the robot is not at its designated position after the time has expired, it must be moved at its designated position immediately. \\

	\item \textbf{Exiting the arena:} When commanded to do so, a robot should leave the arena. \\

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tested abilities \& scoring}
\label{sec:eegpsr-abilities}
Each commanded action involves at least one of the following abilities. During the test, all the abilities listed are evaluated. Completing a command within time 

The following abilities will be scored considering the best execution only (e.g.~successfully grasping scores for \textit{grasping}).

\begin{itemize}
	\item Advanced manipulation (pouring, placing in a box, transporting a tray, etc.).
	\item Awareness (see \refsec{sec:eegpsr_awarenes}).
	\item Complex command understanding (natural language).
	\item Count people / objects in a given location.
	\item Feature recognition (color, gender, gesture, pose, size, etc.).
	\item Gesture recognition.
	\item Object grasping.
	\item Object placing.
	\item Object recognition.
	\item People finding / learning / recognizing.
	\item People following / guiding.
	\item Speech recognition.
\end{itemize}

The following abilities will be scored considering the worst execution only (e.g.~colliding once negates all previous scoring achieved for \textit{navigation}):

\begin{itemize}
	\item Collision-free navigation.
	\item Memory and answering questions.
\end{itemize}


The team may choose to be evaluated in the following abilities (one try only):
\begin{itemize}
	\item Activity detection (waking up, reading, dancing, etc.).
	\item Natural handover (take / give).
	\item Open a door/drawer.
	\item Unknown object description / recognition.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Awareness}
\label{sec:eegpsr-awarenes}
Either, while the robot is executing a task or while the robot is waiting for a command, an \textit{unexpected} event may occur, having the robot to \textbf{properly identify it} and react to it.

These \textit{unexpected} events will only occur within the field of view of the robot, and include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Waving:} The operator waves to the robot expecting the robot to approach to them, prior to give a command.
	\item \textbf{Falling down:} The person being followed by the robot suddenly falls down, robot must offer assistance.
	\item \textbf{Walking away:} One of the people in the crowd being counted suddenly leaves the room. \\ \textbf{Remark: in this case the people count reported by the robot will be valid for both: including and excluding the person who left.}
	\item \textbf{Door shutting:} A door is suddenly shut while the robot is on its way to it.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Remark:} for security concerns, team must notify the referees when the robot lacks of awareness.

\subsection{Additional rules and remarks}
\label{sec:eegpsr-remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{CONTINUE rule:} Teams are able to use the CONTINUE rule in this test, with all the standard penalties it involves as described in section \refsec{asrcontinue}.
	%The CONTINUE rule can only be used with the custom operator (e.g. both penalties of custom speaker and CONTINUE rule will be applied). \\

	\item \textbf{Number of Teams and Scheduling:} In each test slot, \eegpsrTeams teams will be competing in the arena concurrently. The robots will be tested in an interleaved fashion: The robots will retrieve commands and execute the task one after the other. As stated above, each robot will have a maximum amount of \eegpsrMaxCmdTime minutes per command (including time for retrieving the command and executing it). However, the sum of each of the times it took to carry each command should not exceed \eegpsrMaxTeamTime minutes. This means that if the robot took
%	4 minutes to carry out its first command and another 4 minutes for its second command, it only has 2 minutes to carry out its third command. However, if it only took
	2 minutes for the first and 2 minutes for the second, it still only has \eegpsrMaxCmdTime minutes for the third. To facilitate a fluent and untroubled performance of the robots, the other robots must always return or being returned to their designated position before the next robot will be given a command. If a robot moves from its designated position while another robot is working on a command, it must be immediately disabled and moved to its designated position. If a restart is still available to the team, it can be restarted at its designated position. To carry the robot, at most two team members are allowed in the arena, and the robot must be moved as quickly as possible. To start or restart the robot, at most one team member may operate the robot. The team members moving and operating the robots must leave the arena immediately after the robot is placed or started. \\

	\item \textbf{Referees:} Since the score system in this test involves a subjective evaluation of the robot's behavior, the referees are EC/TC members. One referee is assigned to each team to judge performance, to measure the time for working on a command, and to keep track of the overall operating time of the robot. \\

	\item \textbf{Operator:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The person operating the robot is one of the referees (default operator).
		\item If the robot appears to consistently not be able to understand the operator, the referees ask the team to continue with a custom operator, reducing the obtained score for that command to 75\% (\refsec{asrcontinue}).
		\item If the robot appears to consistently not be able to understand the custom operator, the referees ask the team to continue with the alternate method, reducing the obtained score for that command to 25\% (\refsec{asrcontinue}).
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Inoperative robots:} If a robot gets stuck while trying to accomplish a task during a reasonable amount of time (e.g.~30 seconds), the referee may ask the team to move back the robot to its designated position, proceeding with the next robot. \\

	\item \textbf{Restarts/Changing/Charging batteries:} The team may install a charging station at the designated position of the robot, if it does not hinder the other robots. However, the robot must connect itself with the charging station after carrying out a command. Changing batteries or manually connecting the robot with the charging station is allowed during a restart. The general rules for restart apply. \\

	\item \textbf{Scoring:} Robots are scored by successfully performed ability and full command completion within time. 
\end{enumerate}
