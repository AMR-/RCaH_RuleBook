The questions the robot must answer in the RoboGame test are taken from a small set of predefined trivia questions including information about the arena, the crowd, the list of predefined objects, and the robot's environment.

\section{Arena Questions}

    \item Where is the shelf? $\rightarrow$ \textit{The shelf is in the kitchen}
    \item Where is the plant? $\rightarrow$ \textit{The shelf is in the living room}
