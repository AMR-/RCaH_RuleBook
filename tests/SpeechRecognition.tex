\section{Speech Recognition \& Audio Detection Test}

This test is divided in two phases. First the robot must answer a set of questions to an operator at the first attempt without asking for confirmation. The operator is not allowed to move to the robot or shout to the robot.

For the second phase, the focus is to carry out Sound Source Localization (SSL) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) at the same time. To this effect, volunteers will stand around the robot and a randomly chosen volunteer will ask a question. The robot is expected to turn towards that volunteer and answer the question. If the robot is NOT able to carry out SSL and ASR at the same time (e.g. it needs to turn towards the speaking volunteer using SSL before doing ASR), the robot is allowed to request to repeat the question (with a penalty). In addition, if SSL cannot be carried out, the robot may still answer the question without turning, but no points will be provided for SSL.

The questions the robot must answer will be a small set of predefined trivia questions, some questions about objects in the arena and some questions will be about the persons surrounding the robot.

\subsection{Goal}
The robot must be able to properly recognize and answer to a limited set of questions (according to a grammar) without asking for confirmation. 
Also, the robot shall be able to react to a speaking operator which is not facing towards to.

After recognizing the speech of a question, the robot must be able to deduce the answer from available knowledge or find a way to answer the question by looking around.

\subsection{Focus}
This test focuses on voice recognition, natural language understanding and audio-source localization in a noisy environment, with moving sound sources\footnote{This test may also be held outside the arena}.
Additionally, the test requires the robot to consult and gather information about the (direct) environment.
This involves the appearance and locations of objects in the arena as well as features of the persons around the robot. 

For the information about the arena, the robot is assumed to already possess the needed knowledge. It should not drive away. 
When answering questions about persons, the robot may gather the information on the spot, i.e. it should look around. 

\subsection{Setup}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The apartment is in its normal state.
\item All doors of the apartment are open, except for the entry door. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Task}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Direct speech recognition: } The robot should move (or be moved) to a previously specified point inside the arena. 
  A TC member will ask 8 questions in front of the robot. 
  The robot should answer the question without asking confirmation.
  A question will only be asked once; there are no repetitions of a question. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The operator shall be standing still and facing to the robot.
\item The operator shall be between 0.75 and 1.0 meters away from the robot position.
\item The operator shall be between -60$^{\circ}$ and 60$^{\circ}$ from the robot's center (front range).
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Indirect speech recognition: } A group of several volunteers will stand around the robot as in Figure \ref{fig:asrsetup}, standing still, facing the robot, and between 0.75 to 1.0 meters away from it. The number of volunteers may change from the Figure. A random person of this group will ask a question of the same set described in the first part of the test. Before answering, the robot can do one or both of the following (each providing different amount of points):
\begin{itemize}
\item Answer the question,
\item Turn towards the person that asked the question,
\item Ask for only one repetition of the question, if needed (penalty).
\end{itemize}
This process will repeat 8 times. No attempt may receive negative points. When the robot provides an answer it should not ask for confirmation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Questions}
% In previous years, the robots only had to answer questions from a list of pre-defined trivia questions. 
In addition to 10 predefined trivia-questions, the robot will be asked some questions about the RoboCup arena and about the persons surrounding the robot. 

The arena-questions will be about the color, shape, size and type of the scenario objects \refsec{rule:scenario_objects} and where each object is usually found. 
For example:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item What color is the shampoo? $\rightarrow$ The shampoo is blue.
 \item What is the color of the sponge $\rightarrow$ The sponge is green.
 \item What type of thing is the beer? $\rightarrow$ Beer a kind of drink. 
 \item Where can I find the beer? $\rightarrow$ The beer is in the fridge, nice and cool. 
 \item Tell me where the plates are. $\rightarrow$ The plate is in the cupboard. 
 \item How big is the egg? $\rightarrow$ The egg is a couple of centimeters big.
 \item What shape is the egg? $\rightarrow$ It is egg-shaped of course. 
 \item Where is the shampoo? $\rightarrow$ The shampoo is in the closet. 
 \item What objects are in the closet? $\rightarrow$ The shampoo, soap, the sponge and a cloth. \textbf{Or:} The closet contains toiletries.
 \item What is the color of \textit{them}? $\rightarrow$ They are blue. 
 \item Where is the shampoo? $\rightarrow$ In the closet. 
 \item What is \textit{it}'s color? $\rightarrow$ The shampoo is blue. 
\end{enumerate}
Note that the robot does not have to go and find out the answer; it should be able to infer the answers from knowledge it already has. 

The person related questions can be about gender, age and pose (sitting, standing, raised arm).
For example: 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item What age is the standing person? $\rightarrow$ 25.
 \item Is/was \textit{that} a boy or a girl? $\rightarrow$ The standing person is a woman. 
 \item How old do you think I am? $\rightarrow$ 23.
 \item Is the sitting person a man or woman? $\rightarrow$ A man.
 \item Am I a man or a woman? $\rightarrow$ You're the man!
\end{enumerate}

Please note that some these questions refer to the previous answer.

\subsection{Additional rules and remarks}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Continue rule:} Continue rule (Section \refsec{rule:asrcontinue}) can not be used during this test.
\item \textbf{Question timeout:} If the robot does not answer within 10 seconds, the question is considered as \textit{missed}, and the TC member will proceed with the next question.
\item \textbf{Understanding the answer:} If the robot's answer is not understood by the operator, it is considered as \textit{incorrect}, and the TC member will proceed with the next question. It is thus advised that the robot provide answers such that it is clear that the robot understood the question. For example, if the question is ``What is the capital of Germany?'', instead of just answering ``Berlin'', it is advised that the robot answers something to the effect of ``The capital of Germany is Berlin''.
\item \textbf{Question repetition:} In the second phase, if the robot turns towards the operator to be asked once again, it should clearly state that it requires a repetition of the question once it finishes turning, so as to cue the operator to do so.
\end{itemize}
