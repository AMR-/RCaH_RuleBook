\section{Help-me-carry}
The robot's owner went shopping for groceries and needs help carrying the groceries from the car into the home.

\subsection{Goal}
The robot must bring some items from outside the arena inside the arena.

\subsection{Focus}
This test focuses on following and navigation in an unknown environment. 

\subsection{Setup}
The robot starts waiting inside the arena. 
The owner has a set of bags and boxes tht need to be carried from a place outside the arena back inside. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Start:} Starting location of the robot. %%Close *to* the front door of the appartment?
\item \textbf{Car:} The robots owner has put the groceries in the trunk of the car after shopping. The owner parked the car outside the home.
\item \textbf{Destination:} The items must be transported to a place where they can be stored.  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Task}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Start:} The robot is waiting somewhere in the apartment. The owner approaches the robot and tells it to follow.
\item \textbf{Following:} The robot starts following the owner, who guides the robot to the car with the groceries. 
\item \textbf{Handover groceries:} When the owner stops at the car, the owner gives the robot a command to carry something, e.g. a box or a bag.  The robot puts up its arms and the owner gives the item to the robot.
\item \textbf{Command destination:} The owner of the robot tells where the given item should go, one of the rooms in the arena. 
\item \textbf{Delivery:} The robot then goes inside the house to deliver the item to the destination. 
\item \textbf{Repeat until time is up:} Then, the robot goes back to the car to bring another item inside. 
\end{enumerate}
%% Possible extensions: 
%% - DONE: allow the owner to tell for each item where it should go
%% - At the destination room, there is a person waving, waiting for the robot to bring the items so (s)he can take them
%% - Points for a natural handover. E.g. the human is holding a box and the robot moves in to take it over instead of the humans placing it in the robots arms. Same for the bag
%% - Close the appartment door when the robot is inside?

\subsection{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Delivering items:} At the destination, the robot may place the bag or box at a convenient location: the floor or a table
  \item \textbf{Obstacle avoidance:} The robot will encounter some human(s) on the way between the two locations.  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Platform differentation}
No meaningful alterations to the task can be made to make it more feasible for the standard platforms described in \refsec{rule:standard_platforms}. 

\subsection{Data recording}
  Please record the following data (See \refsec{rule:datarecording}):
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Maps
   \item Plans
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Referee instructions}

The referee needs to
\begin{itemize}
\item Distribute some objects over some boxes and shopping bags.
\item Destignate a few ``car parking locations'' from which the objects must be carried.
