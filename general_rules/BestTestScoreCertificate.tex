	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Bonuses for optional tasks.
		\item Bonuses for using the smart-house environment.
	\end{enumerate}
	% {\bf\item Special tests:} There is no award for the overall highest score in open demonstrations (\iterm{Open Challenge}, \iterm{Demo Challenge} and \iterm{RoboZoo}). 
	{\bf\item Special tests:} There is no award for the overall highest score in \iterm{Open Challenge} and \iterm{RoboZoo}.
\end{enumerate}

\iterm{Best Test Score Certificate} is not given in case the team with the highest score didn't show \emph{sufficient performance} (e.g.~trying to score but not solving the task, see \refsec{rule:fairplay}). The decision about if the award is given is conducted by the \iaterm{Technical Committee}{TC}.
