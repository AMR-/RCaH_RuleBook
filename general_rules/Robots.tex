\section{Robots}
\label{rule:robots}

\subsection{Autonomy \& Mobility}
Robots that participate in the RoboCup@Home league need to be \Term{autonomous}{Autonomy} and \Term{mobile}{Mobility}. Any deviations reported to the TC, may result in a penalty for the team (see \refsec{rule:extraordinary_penalties}).

\subsection{Number of robots}
\label{rule:robots_number}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Registration:} The maximum \term{number of robots} per team that can be registered for the competitions is \emph{two} (2).
	\item \textbf{Regular Tests:} Only one robot is allowed per test. For different tests different robots can be used.
	\item \textbf{Open Demonstrations:} In the \iterm{Open Challenge} and the \iterm{Finals} both robots can be used simultaneously.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Appearance and safety}
\label{rule:robot_appearance}

Robots should have a nice product-like appearance, be safe to operate \& be around and should not annoy its human users. The following rules apply to all robots and are part of the \iterm{Robot Inspection} test (see \refsec{sec:robot_inspection}). 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Cover:} The robot's internal hardware (electronics and cables) should be covered in an appealing way. The use of (visible) duct tape is strictly prohibited.
	\item \textbf{Loose cables:} There may not be any loose cables hanging out of the robot. 
	\item \textbf{Safety:} The robot may not have sharp edges or other things that could severe people.
	\item \textbf{Annoyance:} The robot should not permanently make loud noises or use blinding lights.
	\item \textbf{Driving:} To be safe, the robots should be careful when driving in a direction it cannot sense for example. 
\end{enumerate}
