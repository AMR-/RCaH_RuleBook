\subsection{Standard Platform sub-Leagues}
RoboCup@Home features two Standard Platform sub-Leagues adhering to the rules listed above.

\subsubsection{SPL Modifications}
\label{rule:spl-mods}
The idea of having standarized platform is to allow teams to compete in equality of conditions by eliminating all hardware-dependent variables. Therefore, both standard platform sub-leagues are considered as \emph{closed hardware design}, meaning that and modifications and alterations to the robots are strictly forbidden; including, but not limited to attaching, connecting, plugging, gluing, and taping compontents into and onto the robot, as well as modifying or altering the robot structure. Voiding this rule leads to immediate disqualification from the competition and penalty for the team (see \refsec{rule:extraordinary_penalties}).

All standard platform robots will be inspected by TC during the \iterm{Robot Inspection} test (see \refsec{sec:robot_inspection}), who will verify that the robot is in proper state for the competition, presenting no alterations and in neat condition. In addition, EC and TC members may request re-inspection of a SPL robot at any time during the competition.
