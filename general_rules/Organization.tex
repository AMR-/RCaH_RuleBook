\section{Organization of the competition}
\label{sec:procedure_during_competition}

\subsection{Stage system}\label{rule:stages}

The competition features a \iterm{stage system}. It is organized in two stages each consisting of a number of specific tests. It ends with the \iterm{Finals}.

\begin{enumerate}
	{\bf\item Stage~I:} The first days of the competition will be called \iterm{Stage~I}. All qualified teams can participate in \iterm{Stage~I}. Stage~I comprehends a set of \iterm{Ability Tests} and an \iterm{Integration Test}. Those \iterm{Proficency Tests} are performed at least 3 times each one. The \iterm{RoboZoo} is the open demonstration in \iterm{Stage~I}.

% MAURICIO: The advance schema changed. Also no demo challenge for 2015
%{\bf\item Stage~II:} The best \emph{50\% of teams}\footnote{If the total number of teams is less than 20, then the best 10 teams advance to Stage~II.} (after Stage~I) advance to \iterm{Stage~II}. 
%  Here, more complex abilities or combinations of abilities are tested. 
%  The \iterm{Demo Challenge} is the open---but scoped---demonstration in Stage~II.
	{\bf\item Stage~II:} The best \emph{50\% of teams with full integrated capabilities}\footnote{If the total number of teams is less than 20, up to 10 teams may advance to Stage~II} (after Stage~I) advance to \iterm{Stage~II}. Here, more complex abilities or combinations of abilities are tested. In order to advance to Stage~II a team must successfully solve 3 out of 5 of the \iterm{Proficency Tests} in Stage~I. \\
	The \iterm{Open Challenge} is the open demonstration in Stage~II.
	{\bf\item Final demonstration:} The best \emph{five teams} (after Stage~I and Stage~II) advance to the final round. The final round features only a single open demonstration.
\end{enumerate}

% MAURICIO: No technical challenge for 2015
% In addition, a Technical Challenge (see \refsec{sec:TechnicalChallenge}) is carried out between Stage~II and the Final Demonstration, and its schedule is outside the scope of the Stage system.
In case of having no considerable score deviation between a team advancing to the next stage and a team dropping out, the TC may announce additional teams advancing to the next stage.


\subsection{Number of tests}\label{rule:number_of_tests}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item In \iterm{Stage~I}, the \term{maximum number of tests} that a team can participate in is \emph{five (5)}.
	\item In \iterm{Stage~II}, the \term{maximum number of tests} that a team can participate in is \emph{four (4)}.
	\item None of the tests is mandatory, except for the \iterm{Robot Inspection} test (see \refsec{sec:robot_inspection}), the \iterm{RoboZoo} test (see \refsec{test:INTHOME}), and the \iterm{Basic Functionalities} test (see \refsec{test:BFPS}).
	\item Teams have to indicate to the \iaterm{Organizing Committee}{OC} in which tests they are going to participate. Otherwise, they are automatically added to all test schedules and may receive a penalty when not attending (see \refsec{rule:not_attending}).
\end{enumerate}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Schedule}
\label{rule:schedule}

\begin{enumerate}
	{\bf\item Tests:} The \iaterm{Organizing Committee}{OC} provides schedules for all tests and teams. 
	{\bf\item Slots:} The tests will be held in \iterm{test slots} of approximately two hours.
	{\bf\item Preparation:} The \iaterm{Organizing Committee}{OC} provides schedules for all teams to organize the access to the arena between test slots. In these \iterm{preparation slots} the teams may conduct calibration procedures, remap the arena if necessary, or conduct test runs.
	Preparation slots are inserted whenever possible, but may not be available before all test slots. 
	{\bf\item Arena access:} One hour before a test slot, only the teams participating in that slot are allowed in the arena.
This rule only applies when not having organized \iterm{preparation slots}.   
\end{enumerate}

%\subsection{Score system}\label{rule:score_system}
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%  {\bf\item Stage~I:} The maximum total score per test in Stage~I is \scoring{2000 points}.
%  {\bf\item Stage~II:} The maximum total score per test in Stage~II is \scoring{2600 points}.
%  {\bf\item Special tests:} Tests may specify a maximum total score deviating from the general maximum total scores.  
%  {\bf\item Minimum score:} The minimum total score per test in Stage~I and Stage~II is \scoring{0 points}. 
%  That is, if the total score for a test is below zero, the team does not receive any points.
%  {\bf\item Penalties:} An exception to the \emph{minimum score} rule are penalties. 
%  Both penalties for not attending (see \refsec{rule:not_attending}) and extraordinary 
%  penalties (see \refsec{rule:extraordinary_penalties}) can cause a total negative score. 
%  {\bf\item Partial scores:} All tests---except for the open demonstrations---are rewarded on a partial scoring basis. 
%  \begin{enumerate}
%  \item Tests are split into designated parts.
%  \item Each part is assigned a certain number of points.
%  \item A team that successfully passes a designated part of the test receives points for that part.
%  \item In case of partial success, referees (and TC members) may decide to only award a percentage instead of the full partial score.  
%  \item The total score for a test is the sum of partial scores.
%  \item Partial scores can be negative (e.g.~to penalize failures etc.).
%  \end{enumerate}
%\end{enumerate}

% MAURICIO: Explained Score System
\subsection{Score system}
\label{rule:score_system}

\begin{enumerate}
	{\bf\item Stage~I:} The maximum total score in \iterm{Stage~I} is \scoring{100 points}.
	\begin{enumerate}
		{\bf\item \iterm{Proficency Tests}:} The maximum total score is calculated as the average of the best two runs for that test
		{\bf\item RoboZoo:} The maximum score for \iterm{RoboZoo} is \scoring{5 points}.
	\end{enumerate}

	{\bf\item Stage~II:} Test in \iterm{Stage~II} are rewarded on a task-solved scoring basis.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Each test but the \iterm{Open Challenge} has a main task. The base score for solving the main task is \scoring{25 points}.
		\item The maximum score for \iterm{Open Challenge} is \scoring{20 points}.
		\item Optionals and subtasks add bonus points to the main task score.
	\end{enumerate}

	{\bf\item \iterm{Finals}:} Final score is normalized and special evaluation is used

	{\bf\item Special tests:} Tests may specify a maximum total score deviating from the general maximum total scores.

	{\bf\item Minimum score:} The minimum total score per test in \iterm{Stage~I} and \iterm{Stage~II} is \scoring{0 points}. That is, if the total score for a test is below zero, the team does not receive any points.

	{\bf\item Penalties:} An exception to the \emph{minimum score} rule are penalties. Both penalties for not attending (see \refsec{rule:not_attending}) and extraordinary penalties (see \refsec{rule:extraordinary_penalties}) can cause a total negative score. 

	{\bf\item Partial scores:} All tests---except for the open demonstrations---are rewarded on a partial scoring basis. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Tests are split into designated parts.
		\item Each part is assigned a certain number of points.
		\item A team that successfully passes a designated part of the test receives points for that part.
		\item In case of partial success, referees (and TC members) may decide to only award a percentage instead of the full partial score.  
		\item The total score for a test is the sum of partial scores.
		\item Partial scores can be negative (e.g.~to penalize failures etc.).
	\end{enumerate}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The concept of the final demonstration is the same as that of the \iterm{Open Challenge}, but the performance evaluation is different. 
		\item The are two juries---an \emph{external} consisting of three or more people not from the RoboCup @Home league, and an \emph{internal} formed by the \iaterm{Executive Committee}{EC}. Both juries have different sets of evaluation criteria.
		\item Members of the external jury are selected by the \iaterm{Executive Committee}{EC} on site. 
		\item The demonstration in the \iterm{Finals} does not have to be different from the one shown in the \iterm{Open Challenge}. It does not have to be the same either.
