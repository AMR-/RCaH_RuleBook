RoboCup German Open 2015
========================

Here you can find various definitions, maps, questions etc used in the German Open 2015

- Retries: Because each team has 3 attempts for each stage 1 challenge, there are no restarts within an attempt. 
- GPSR command generator: https://github.com/kyordhel/GPSRCmdGen2015
- Manipulation: teams can pick what shelf will be the empty shelf (of shelf #11) on which to place objects
- Speech recognition: will take place in the kitchen-area. [Questions](https://github.com/RoboCupAtHome/RuleBook/blob/master/GermanOpen2015/speech_recognition/speech_recognition_questions.csv)
- Manipulation: there will be no time to get the PDF from the robot's USB-sticks between tries. Please put a timestamp and team name in the PDF's filename. 
- Restaurant: The rulebook currently states that the **kitchen bar table** is 'next to' the guide phase start/end position. It has not been defined whether this is left or right of the robot. Therefore, teams can choose of which side of the table to start from and thus choose left/right themselves. In China, left or right will be instructed to the robots in a similar way it is done with ordering tables. The rulebook will be updated for this after RGO2015.
