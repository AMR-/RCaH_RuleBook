\chapter{Tests in Stage I}

\begin{itshape}
Stage I comprehends four \textbf{ability tests} and an \textbf{integration test} along with an \textbf{Open Challenge} and an open demonstration for the audience. Each ability test is designed to evaluate the average performance of the robot in one particular skill, providing data for benchmarking. Meanwhile, the integration test has been designed to evaluate how this abilities work together while solving a common task.

All ability and integration tests in Stage I grants 15 points and are performed 3 times. The total score for each of this tests is the average of the best two performances (still to be discussed, perhaps taking only the top 1 or --unlikely-- global average).

In the Open Challenge the robot must be able to show to the Technical Committee the achievements on the main research line of it's own team. This test grants up to 10 points.

RoboZoo (open demonstration for the audience) have no changes from previous years' competitions and is intended to show to an open audience what domestic robots can do. This test grants up to 10 points.

\chapter{Tests in Stage II}

\begin{itshape}
All ability and integration tests in Stage II grants 25 points and are performed only once. Some tests --like Wake-me-up Test-- have optional tasks that grant additional points when performed correctly, clean and fast. TC must be informed if a team is planning to perform any of the optional tasks. No additional time is given while performing optional tasks.
