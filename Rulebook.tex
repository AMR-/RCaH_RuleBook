\chapter{Tests in Stage I}
\label{chap:stage_I}

\begin{itshape}
\iterm{Stage~I} comprehends four \textbf{ability tests} and an \textbf{integration test} along with an open demonstration for the audience. 
  Each ability test is designed to evaluate the average performance of the robot in one particular skill, providing data for benchmarking. 
  Meanwhile, the integration test has been designed to evaluate how this abilities work together while solving a common task.

The total score for ability and integration tests is the average of the best two performances out of preferably three performances (given the time constraints of a competition).
The point of this is the both elimate good and bad luck for the robots/teams and to get a more objective view of the performance, 
  not to give teams time to tweak the robot between test performances. 
  Therefore, the three runs are to be done in direct sequence, i.e. team A goes three times, then team B and so on. 
  This also means that robot should be ready to start the next run of the same test as fast as possible.


\iterm{RoboZoo} (open demonstration for the audience) have no changes from previous years' competitions and is intended to show to an open audience what domestic robots can do. This test grants up to 5 points.

\chapter{Tests in Stage II}
\label{chap:stage_II}

\begin{itshape}
All ability and integration tests in \iterm{Stage~II} grants 250 points (but the \iterm{Open Challenge} which grants 200) and are performed only once. Some tests --like Wake-me-up Test-- have optional tasks that grant additional points when performed correctly, clean and fast. The \iaterm{Technical Committee}{TC} must be informed if a team is planning to perform any of the optional tasks. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, no additional time is given while performing optional tasks.

In the \iterm{Open Challenge} the robot must be able to show to the \iaterm{Technical Committee}{TC} the achievements on the main research line of its own team. This test grants up to 200 points.

\section{Robot & team cooperation}
We encourage robots and teams to work together when performing challenges.
For scoring, points are awarded per subtask. The robot (and thus team) performing the subtask gets the points.
For example, in the Restaurant-challenge, 
  if one robot of team A can take the order and another robot of team B delivers the order,
  then the points for taking the order go to team A, 
  while the points for delivering go to team B.
Of course, team A & B can both perform the challenge in their own turn.
