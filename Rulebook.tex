\chapter{Tests in Stage I}
\label{chap:stage_I}

\begin{itshape}
\iterm{Stage~I} comprehends four \textbf{ability tests} and an \textbf{integration test} along with an open demonstration for the audience. Each ability test is designed to evaluate the average performance of the robot in one particular skill, providing data for benchmarking. Meanwhile, the integration test has been designed to evaluate how this abilities work together while solving a common task.

The total score for ability and integration tests is the average of the best two performances.

\iterm{RoboZoo} (open demonstration for the audience) have no changes from previous years' competitions and is intended to show to an open audience what domestic robots can do. This test grants up to 5 points.

\chapter{Tests in Stage II}
\label{chap:stage_II}

\begin{itshape}
All ability and integration tests in \iterm{Stage~II} grants 25 points (but the \iterm{Open Challenge} which grants 20) and are performed only once. Some tests --like Wake-me-up Test-- have optional tasks that grant additional points when performed correctly, clean and fast. The \iaterm{Technical Committee}{TC} must be informed if a team is planning to perform any of the optional tasks. No additional time is given while performing optional tasks.

In the \iterm{Open Challenge} the robot must be able to show to the \iaterm{Technical Committee}{TC} the achievements on the main research line of it's own team. This test grants up to 20 points.
