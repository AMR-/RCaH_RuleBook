The maximum time for this test is 60 minutes.

Robots are scored on functionality and on design.
The audience can awards tokens for what they elect to be the \textbf{Most functional robot} and the \textbf{Best looking robot}.

\begin{scorelist}

	\scoreitem{0}{Appearance ~~~~~~~~~~$25 \times \frac{this}{best}$}
	\scoreitem{0}{Performance ~~~~~~~~~$25 \times \frac{this}{best}$}


	\setTotalScore{50}
\end{scorelist}

\textbf{Normalization}: The teams with less tokens than the best team get proportional score based
on the number of tokens they received, e.g 
$\text{score for this team} = 25 \times \frac{t_{this}}{t_{best}}$
where $t_{this}$, $t_{best}$ is the number of tokens received by this team, and the number of tokens received by the best team.
