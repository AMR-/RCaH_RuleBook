The maximum time for this test is 5 minutes.

The report will be normalized to the amount of people in the crowd, minus the operator. 
Let $F$ the amount of females in the crowd, $M$ the amount of males and $N$ be the total amount of people. 
The points for stating a persons' gender correctly is then normalized to the total amount of people in the crowd. 

%% 60 = (150 - 20 - 10) / 2
\begin{scorelist}
      \scoreitem{20}{Correctly state operator pose}
      \scoreitem{10}{Correctly state crowd's size}
      \scoreitem{60}{Correctly state genders $\frac{1}{N} \times$}
      \scoreitem{-60}{Incorrectly state genders $\frac{1}{N} \times$}
      \setTotalScore{150}
\end{scorelist}
