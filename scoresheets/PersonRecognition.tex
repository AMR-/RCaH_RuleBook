The maximum time for this test is 5 minutes.

Scoring in this test requires a report in PDF format to be delivered to the TC for further statement validation. Scoring for stating the people gender in the crowd is normalized to the crowd size. 

%% 120 = (150 - 20 - 10)
\begin{scorelist}
	\scoreheading{Operator}
	\scoreitem{20}{State operator's gender}
	\scoreitem{20}{State operator pose}
	\scoreitem{20}{Unambiguously indicate operator position (approching, pointing at or describing relative position)}

	\scoreheading{Crowd (requires report validation)}
	\scoreitem{10}{State crowd's size (with no false positives)}
	\scoreitem{80}{Reporting gender of people in the crowd}
	\setTotalScore{150}
\end{scorelist}

\paragraph{Normalization:}
Let $N$ be the total amount of people in the crowd counting the operator, and $c, i$  the \textbf{c}orrectly and \textbf{i}ncorrectly labeled gender count respectively, excluding the operator. Scoring for \textit{reporting gender of people in the crowd} is calculated by following the next formula:
$$score = 80 \times \frac{max(c - i, 0)}{N-1}$$

A perfect score is when $C = N-1$ meaning all people in the crowd were correctly identified, but in case most people were incorrectly identified, the score is set to zero.
