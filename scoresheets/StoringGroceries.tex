The maximum time for this test is 1+3 minutes.
The first minute is for the robot to open the Cupboard's door on its own.
If the robot is not able to open the door within that minute, it will be opened by the referee. 
In case the robot opens the door within the minute, the robot has a small time advantage.

	% TODO: Split up scores over these 3 variants of a correct label:
	% 1: As unknown, instead of wrongly applying a label from the known or alike objects (e.g. use an Open World assumption in your classifier)
	% 2: Label all instances of the same unknwon class with the same generated label, e.g. label0, so distinguish between different onknown objects
	% 3: Label the unknown objects with a meaningful label, eg. cookies in case its a sort of cookies. I.e. use a classifier that knows many classes.
