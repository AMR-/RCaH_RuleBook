The maximum time for this test is 3 minutes.
The robot is given 1 extra minute to open the cupboard door. 
If the robot is not able to open the door within that minute, it will be opened by the referee. 
In case the robot opens the door within the minute, the robot has a small time advantage. 

\begin{scorelist}
% There are 5 filled shelves, originally with 2 objects, 1 in each corner.
% The table also has 10 objects, that the robot should move to the shelf.
% So 20 objects in total
% This can be a tight fit, as there will be potentially 4 objects per shelf, as the robots moves them from the table one by one

% The robots are not fast enough though to do more than 5 objects in the given time.

% Grasp (any object): 10
% Place (anywhere in the cupboard): 10
% Place in correct place: 15
% Recognize known object correctly (without grasping/placing something of that class): 10
% Label two unknown objects of the same class with the same label (e.g. ``class0''): 15

% Place known object near known object of same class: 40
% Place unknown object near unknown object of the same class: 50
