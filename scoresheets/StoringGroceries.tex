The maximum time for this test is 3 minutes.

\begin{scorelist}
% There are 5 filled shelves
% On each shelf, there can fit 4 objects: 2 originally there, in the corners. As each object may get a 'companion' put there by the robot, there are 2 more objects per shelf.

% Grasp (any object): 10
% Place (anywhere in the cupboard): 10
% Place in correct place: 15
% Recognize known object correctly (without grasping/placing something of that class): 10
% Label two unknown objects of the same class with the same label (e.g. ``class0''): 15

% Place known object near known object of same class: 40
% Place unknown object near unknown object of the same class: 50


	\scoreheading{Grasping objects}
	\scoreitem[5]{10}{For each successful grasp of any object (lifting it up to at least 5 cm for more than 10 seconds)}

	\scoreheading{Placing objects}
	\scoreitem[5]{10}{For each successful placement of an object anywhere in the cupboard (safely stands still for more than 10 seconds)}
	\scoreitem[5]{5}{For each successful placement of an object at correct place (near an object of the same class)}

	\scoreheading{Recognizing objects}
	\scoreitem[5]{10}{Every correctly recognized known or alike object in the report file}
	\scoreitem[5]{15}{Corresponding labels for pairs of unknown objects of the same class, in the report file 
            \footnote{Suppose there is a rubber ducky as an unknown object class. Two rubber duckies must be given the same label (e.g. ``label0'') to receive these points}}
	\scoreitem[5]{-5}{False positive label}
