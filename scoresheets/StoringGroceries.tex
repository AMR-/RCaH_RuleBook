The maximum time for this test is 3 minutes.

\begin{scorelist}
% Grasp (any object): 10
% Place (anywhere in the cupboard): 10
% Place in correct place: 15
% Recognize known object correctly (without grasping/placing something of that class): 10
% Label two unknown objects of the same class with the same label (e.g. ``class0''): 15

% Place known object near known object of same class: 40
% Place unknown object near unknown object of the same class: 50

	\scoreitem[5]{10}{For each successful grasp of any object (lifting it up to at least 5 cm for more than 10 seconds)}

	\scoreheading{Placing objects}
	\scoreitem[5]{10}{For each successful placement of an object anywhere in the cupboard (safely stands still for more than 10 seconds)}
	\scoreitem[5]{5}{For each successful placement of an object at correct place (near an object of the same class)}

	\scoreheading{Recognizing objects}

	\scoreitem[1]{20}{Open the door without human help}  % Or make this a bonus, but then there is a time issue as opening the door takes time. I think a penalty provides a better incentive

\subsection{Score examples} 
\begin{itemize}
 \item Robot A fails at all manipulation attempts but makes an excellent report, with the 5 known objects labeled correctly and the 5 pairs of unknown objects correctly, will get 
$5*10 + 5*15 = 125$ points. 
 \item Robot B that fails to recognize anything but does move all the objects from the table to anywhere in the cupboard receives $5*10 + 5*10 = 100$ points.
 \item Robot C grasps a single unknown item (``Cookies''), places it at the correct position near the other ``Cookies'' and also makes the same excelent report as robot A will get 
10 points for grasping, 10 for placing anywhere and an additional 5 for placing at the right location, so 25 for that single object.
The  total for robot C is then 150 points.
