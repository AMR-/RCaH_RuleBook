The maximum time for this test is 3 minutes.
The robot is given 1 extra minute to open the cupboard door. 
If the robot is not able to open the door within that minute, it will be opened by the referee. 
In case the robot opens the door within the minute, the robot has a small time advantage. 

\begin{scorelist}
% There are 5 filled shelves, originally with 2 objects, 1 in each corner.
% The table also has 10 objects, that the robot should move to the shelf.
% So 20 objects in total
% This can be a tight fit, as there will be potentially 4 objects per shelf, as the robots moves them from the table one by one

% The robots are not fast enough though to do more than 5 objects in the given time.

% Grasp (any object): 10
% Place (anywhere in the cupboard): 10
% Place in correct place: 15
% Recognize known object correctly (without grasping/placing something of that class): 10
% Label two unknown objects of the same class with the same label (e.g. ``class0''): 15

% Place known object near known object of same class: 40
% Place unknown object near unknown object of the same class: 50


	\scoreheading{Grasping objects}

	\scoreheading{Placing objects}
	\scoreitem[5]{10}{For each successful placement of an object anywhere in the cupboard (safely stands still for more than 10 seconds)}
	\scoreitem[5]{5}{For each successful placement of an object at correct place (near an object of the same class)}

	\scoreheading{Recognizing objects}
	\scoreitem[10]{5}{Every correctly recognized known or alike object in the report file}
	% TODO: Split up scores over these 3 variants of a correct label:
	% 1: As unknown, instead of wrongly applying a label from the known or alike objects (e.g. use an Open World assumption in your classifier)
	% 2: Label all instances of the same unknwon class with the same generated label, e.g. label0, so distinguish between different onknown objects
	% 3: Label the unknown objects with a meaningful label, eg. cookies in case its a sort of cookies. I.e. use a classifier that knows many classes. 
	\scoreitem[5]{15}{Correctly label unknown objects}
