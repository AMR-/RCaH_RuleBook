\section{Robo-Nurse}

The robot is assisting an elderly person with getting her pills and responding to observed activities.

\subsection{Focus}

This test focuses mainly on Human-Robot Interaction and Activity Recognition.

\subsection{Task}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Move to the patient}: The patient (lets call her Granny) calls for robot assistance using her voice or by waving arms.
	\item \textbf{Asking for pills}: Granny asks the robot for her pills which are in bottles located on a shelf nearby. 
	\item \textbf{Describe and choose pills}: On the shelf, there are multiple bottles with pills and the robot must asks Granny which bottle she needs.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The robot must indicate what bottles are on the shelf by briefly describing each bottle.
		\textbf{the faster the robot starts describing (i.e. finished recognizing) after arrival (standing still in front of the shelf) at the shelf, the better: faster recognition gives more points. }
		\begin{itemize}
 			\item \quotes{The leftmost one}
  			\item \quotes{The \textit{color} bottle}
  			\item \quotes{The big/small bottle}
  			\item Any other description the robot understands and spoke out loud to Granny. E.g. if a robot can do text recognition and read each label to Granny, she may reply with e.g. \quotes{Asperine}.
 		\end{itemize}
 	\end{itemize}
 	\item \textbf{Grasp \& handover pills}: The robot must grasp the indicated bottle of pills and hand them over to Granny. The handover to Granny must be \quotes{natural}, without a voice confirmation of when to let the pills go etc. Granny will take the pills from the robot's hand and the robot must open its hand.
 	\item \textbf{Activity Recognition}: One of the activities below happens and the robot must act accordingly:
 	\begin{itemize}
 		\item \textbf{Drop blanket}: Granny's stands up and sits doen immediately. Her blanket falls over her lap on to the ground. The robot must \textbf{pick up the blanket} and hand it to Granny
 		\item \textbf{Fall}: Granny stands up from her chair and falls. The robot must \textbf{hand Granny a phone} or use the Smart Home for that. 
								The phone will be laying on the coffee table in the living room.
 		\item \textbf{Walk and sit}: Granny walks to a table with her walking stick/cane. Robot must follow and take walking stick from Granny after she sits down an a chair closeby.
 	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Additional rules and remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Continue Rule:} The CONTINUE rule may be applied several times in the Conversation part of the test (Section \ref{rule:asrcontinue}).
\item \textbf{Make it fast:} Description of objects should be fast, as is reflected in the scoring.
% \item The bottles of pills are not known beforehand and must be recognized and described on the spot by the robot. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Referee instructions}

The referee needs to
\begin{itemize}
\item Place the bottles on the shelf.
\item Lay the phone on the coffee table.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{OC instructions}

\textbf{2 hours before the test}
\begin{itemize}
\item Announce the room where the patient is
\end{itemize}
\textbf{During the test}
\begin{itemize}
\item Instruct Granny which pills she wants.
\item Instruct Granny which of the 3 actions to perform.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Score sheet}
