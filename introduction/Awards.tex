% \subsection{Winner of the Technical Challenge}
% In parallel to the regular competition, the RoboCup@Home league features a \iterm{technical challenge}. The winner of the technical challenge is given a special \iterm{award for winning the technical challenge}.
%
% As with the innovation award, the award for winning the technical challenge is not given in case no team shows a \emph{sufficient performance}. The decision which team wins the technical challenge, and if the award is given at all, is conducted by the \iaterm{Technical Committee}{TC}.

\subsection{Skill Certificates}
  \label{award:skill}
  The @Home league features certificates for the robots best at a the skills below:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item Navigation
   \item Manipulation
   \item Speech Recognition
   \item Person Recognition
  \end{itemize}
  
  A team is given the certificate if it scored at least 75\% of the attainable points for that skill.
  This is counted over all challenges, so e.g. if the robot scores manipulation points during the navigation test to open the door, that will count for the Manipulation-certificate.
  The certificate will only be handed out if the team is \emph{not} the overall winner of the competition.
